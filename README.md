# Sass & RWD Workshop Project

This project was created as part of the **Coders Lab – JavaScript Frontend Developer** course.  
It focuses on practicing **Sass (SCSS)**, **responsive web design**, and **modern CSS architecture** through a set of structured tasks.

## About the project
The main goal of this project was to:

- work with **Sass variables, maps, mixins, loops, and modules**,
- build reusable and scalable styles using **SCSS partials**,
- practice **mobile-first responsive design**,
- implement layout logic using **Flexbox**,
- understand proper **project structure** and workflow,
- use **Git & GitHub** for version control.

Each task was implemented in a dedicated SCSS partial and compiled into a main stylesheet.

## What was implemented
During the project, I worked on:

- creating a basic CSS reset and global styles,
- defining and manipulating color palettes using Sass maps,
- building reusable mixins (e.g. dialog boxes, arrows),
- creating a custom responsive grid system,
- implementing responsive layouts with media queries,
- ensuring proper scaling of media elements across different screen sizes.

## Technologies used
